Siam Thai Athens Restaurant Menu

I added HTML, JAVASCRIPT, AND CSS.

There is the logo at the header, hours inside the button once pressed, address that'll direct you to Google Maps once clicked, phone number that'll call the business once clicked, a whole menu of the food/drinks Siam Thai has to offer, and a Hamburger Menu that will open and you can select which section of the menu you would like to view. It responds to desktop/laptop, mobile devices, and tablets.
