Siam Thai Athens Restaurant Menu

Visit the web page
http://siamthaiathens.com

I added HTML, JAVASCRIPT, AND CSS.

There is the logo at the header, hours inside the button once pressed, an address that'll direct you to Google Maps once clicked, the phone number that'll call the business once clicked, a whole menu of the food/drinks Siam Thai has to offer, and a Hamburger Menu that will open and you can select which section of the menu you would like to view. It responds to desktop/laptop, mobile devices, and tablets.

The website has a white background with a black and gold menu style to match the restaurant's physical menus, and the tablet/mobile has a different color logo. The background is dark, so it will give you the feeling of holding the physical menu from your mobile device.
